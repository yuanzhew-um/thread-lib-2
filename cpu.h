/*
 * cpu.h -- interface to the simulated CPU
 *
 * This interface is used mainly by the thread library.
 * The only part that is used by application programs is cpu::boot().
 *
 * This class is implemented almost entirely by the infrastructure.  The
 * responsibilities of the thread library are to implement the cpu constructor
 * (and any functions you choose to add) and manage interrupt_vector_table
 * (and any variables you choose to add).
 *
 * You may add new variables and functions to this class.  If you add variables
 * to the cpu class, add them at the *end* of the class definition, and do not
 * exceed the 1 KB total size limit for the class.
 *
 * Do not modify any of the given variable and function declarations.
